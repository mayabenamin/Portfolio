    <h5> The chicken or the egg: can politicians control grocery prices as promised?</h3>

        A stranger to store shelves, eggs cause widespread sticker shock among shoppers around the country.</div>

        While grocery prices drove people toward the polls just months ago, they now drive widespread commotion and frustration. 
        A hot topic on the campaign trail, the prospect of lower prices, particularly of groceries and gas, was a factor in 96% 
        of voters’ decisions, according to <a href= "https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/votecast/"> AP VoteCast </a>. 
        However, more factors than political administration impact the price of goods.
        <p></p>
 	   Although Trump tempted voters with the hope of lower grocery prices, since taking office, shoppers haven’t felt relief. Data 
       from the <a href= "https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/supplemental-files/">U.S. Census Bureau’s Consumer Price Index</a> shows 
       that gas prices have decreased significantly over the last ten months, however, food prices have risen steadily, with a 
       particular spike in meat, poultry, fish and eggs.

        Back in August, Trump campaigned on the pledge that he would bring grocery prices down saying, “a vote for Trump means your 
        groceries will be cheaper.” However, soon after his election, Trump expressed less confidence in his ability to lower prices 
        in Time Magazine’s “Person of the Year” interview.
        <p></p>
        “Look, they got them up. I'd like to bring them down,” Trump said. “It's hard to bring things down once they're up. 
        You know, it's very hard. But I think that they will.” As Trump continued to promise to reduce grocery prices, a 
        violent force laid in his way: avian flu.

        Egg prices had already been a source of gripe among voters, but recent outbreaks of avian flu, or bird flu, have 
        impacted flocks across the country and resulted in egg shortages and increased egg prices. 
        The average price of a dozen large, grade A eggs cost an average of $2.522 in January 2024, according data from the 
        <a href= "https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/APU0000708111">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. This average price has 
        nearly doubled with eggs pricing in at an average of $4.953 this January.
        <p></p>
        Although egg angst is widespread, some states have recorded more infected flocks than others. All of the five states 
        with the largest number of infected chickens turned red in the 2024 election.

        Considering Trump’s adamancy that he would lower prices, these statistics beg the question: how much control does a 
        politician have over grocery prices?
        <p></p>
        On February 26, Trump’s administration announced that they intend to invest $1 billion to manage the temper skyrocketing 
        egg prices. This five-part plan allocates funds to give farmers financial aid, reduce egg production regulations and 
        investigate import opportunities, increase biosecurity on farms and fund vaccine research. Agriculture Secretary Brooke 
        Rollins recognized that there is no “silver bullet” in eliminating bird flu in her opinion piece in the 
        <a href= "https://www.wsj.com/opinion/agriculture-secretary-brooke-rollins-my-plan-to-lower-egg-prices-6be0f881">Wall Street Journal</a>. 
        Rollins said that this plan will not solve the problem overnight, and expressed confidence that the egg market will be 
        stabilized in three to sixth months, starkly contrasting Trump’s campaign promise to “immediately bring prices down, staring 
        on day one.” 
        <p></p>
        Should American voters at large and specifically those in highly affected states feel shortchanged now that campaign promises 
        have failed to come to fruition? Or were these promises unrealistic and should voters have recognized their unattainability?
        <p></p>
        Regardless of the feasibility of campaign promises, presidential candidates sway voters by the promises they make on the 
        campaign trail. While candidates use a myriad of tactics, it’s hard to decipher the difference between concrete plans and 
        campaign strategery. 
        <p></p>
        Trump has not delivered on his day one campaign promise, but this promise was inevitably unattainable. Trump entered office 
        when bird flu was already running rampant and it was certain that managing egg prices would be on his to-do list not his 
        day-one checklist.
